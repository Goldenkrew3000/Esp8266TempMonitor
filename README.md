# Esp8266TempMonitor

# NOTICE
This is just some personal code that I am backing up on Github to monitor temperature.<br>
Yes, the code is messy, but I wrote it in like 30 minutes with a headache.<br>

A simple program written in Arduino for the ESP8266 to read a MAX6675 K Type Thermocouple and output the result over MQTT for Home Assistant
